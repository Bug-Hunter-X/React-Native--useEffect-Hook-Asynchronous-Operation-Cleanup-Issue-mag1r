The solution involves adding a cleanup function to the `useEffect` hook. This function will be responsible for unsubscribing or canceling any ongoing asynchronous operations before the component is unmounted.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someStream.subscribe(data => {
    // Update state with data
  });

  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe(); // Clean up the subscription
  };
}, []);
```
This corrected code ensures that the `subscription.unsubscribe()` method is called when the component unmounts, preventing resource leaks and ensuring proper application behavior.
