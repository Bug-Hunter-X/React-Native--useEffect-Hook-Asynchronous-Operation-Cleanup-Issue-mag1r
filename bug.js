In React Native, a less common error arises when using asynchronous operations within the `useEffect` hook without proper cleanup.  If you fetch data or subscribe to events inside `useEffect`, forgetting to return a cleanup function can lead to memory leaks or unexpected behavior when the component unmounts.  This is particularly problematic with long-running processes or subscriptions that don't automatically stop. For example:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someStream.subscribe(data => {
    // Update state with data
  });
  // Missing cleanup function
}, []);
```
This code subscribes to `someStream` but doesn't unsubscribe when the component unmounts.  The subscription remains active, potentially causing issues.
